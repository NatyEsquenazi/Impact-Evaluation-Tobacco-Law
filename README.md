# Advocating for a tobacco-free future through the new control law in Cordoba, Argentina

Despite tobacco being a major cause of death, smoking rates continue to rise, particularly among youths. Governments worldwide have implemented various tobacco control policies, including health education, anti-smoking ads, advertising restrictions, public smoking bans, and increased taxes, to address this issue.

In Argentina, a tobacco-producing country, national policies include a 2003 public smoking ban. Locally, Cordoba has uniquely strengthened these efforts by adding strict bans on tobacco advertising, sponsorship, and promotion. The effectiveness of these measures, however, requires thorough evaluation.

This paper investigates the impact of Cordoba's new tobacco control regulations on youth smoking rates using robust evaluation methods and matching techniques. It aims to provide policymakers with evidence of the causal relationship between advertising bans and youth smoking behavior changes.

The paper begins with a detailed overview of youth smoking in Argentina and Cordoba, then describes the new regulations. It discusses the "Health Conditions" survey as the main data source and outlines the methodological framework, including treatment and control groups, matching techniques, and regression methods. Results are interpreted, and recommendations for compliance and control are provided.

The study emphasizes the importance of evidence-based policymaking and aims to inform and support efforts to reduce youth smoking in Cordoba and beyond.
